## Code Review Process

### How to Perform a Code Review

If you are a contributor or maintainer and you want to review a pull request, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Understand the Changes:**
   - Read through the pull request description to understand the proposed changes.
   - Look at the related issues (if mentioned) to understand the context.

   - Check the code for clarity, readability.
   - Verify that the code is efficient and free of obvious bugs or security issues.

3. **Provide Constructive Feedback:**
   - Leave comments on specific lines or sections of the code.
   - Be constructive and polite in your feedback. Suggest improvements and explain why certain changes might be beneficial.
   - Use phrases like "Consider...", "Could we...", or "It might be better to..." to keep the feedback positive.

4. **Approve or Request Changes:**
   - If the pull request is good to go, approve it.
   - If it needs changes, select "Request Changes" and leave detailed feedback on what should be improved.

### How to Receive Code Review

As a contributor submitting a pull request, please follow these guidelines when receiving feedback:

1. **Be Open to Feedback:**
   - Code review is a collaborative process aimed at improving the codebase.
   - Be open to suggestions and don't take feedback personally. It's about the code, not the coder.

2. **Understand the Feedback:**
   - Read through the review comments carefully. If something is unclear, feel free to ask for clarification.

   - Address the feedback by making changes to your code.
   - Commit your changes to the same branch used for the pull request and push the updates.

4. **Notify Reviewers:**
   - Add a comment on the pull request to notify the reviewers that you have made the requested changes.

5. **Discuss Further If Needed:**
   - If you disagree with a suggestion, explain your reasoning respectfully in the comments.
